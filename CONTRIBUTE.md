## Guidelines

There are a couple of guidelines we suggest sticking to:

* Add this repository as an `upstream` remote.
* Keep your `master` branch clean. This means you can easily pull changes made to this repository into yours.
* Create a new branch for each new feature or set of related bug fixes.
* Never merge from your local branches into your `master` branch. Only update that by pulling from `upstream/master`.
