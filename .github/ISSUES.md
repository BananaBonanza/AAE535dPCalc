# Issues

## How to create new issues properly

GitHub issues are used for everything from bug reporting to suggesting long-term ideas. You can make everything run much smoother by following some simple rules.

### Rule zero

Always give your issue a meaningful title as this is the first thing anyone will see.

Note: `[CR]` and `[WIP]` "tags" are meaningful only for PRs. All open issues by definition are request for comments and work in progress.

### Bug reports

Before you submit a bug always search the current list of issues to see if it has been reported already.

Your bug report has to include:

- On what OS did you experience the problem (Windows, Linux, OS X etc.)
- What version were you using
- Description of the problem written in a way that enables anyone to try and recreate it

Your bug report may include:

- Screenshot(s) as some things are best explained visually
- Workbook save file

Bonus points for:

- Checking if the bug exists under latest build
- Checking if it is OS specific

The OS and Program version are very important - with the pace of changes here it is possible the bug you have encountered has already been fixed. After that reproducibility is the key, so write your report with all the necessary details.

### Enhancements and addition ideas

We may have a dozen or so issues open at a time - most of them are ideas and suggestions. If you have a general idea or anything that can't be easily described in terms of *current* code changes you'd be better off suggesting it in an email directed to one of the contributers (or by joining one of our meetings). You'll also get much broader exposure for your idea with that method. After developing a polished idea, it should be easy to make a GitHub issue for it.

Please first search if something like what you have on mind has been already proposed. If so, feel free to join the discussion! If your idea is related but sufficiently different, open a new issue and refer to the older discussion (use GitHub's `#issue_number` reference system).

Remember to take part in any discussions relating to your suggestions

### Questions

You should direct your questions to the Slack. You should also read the included documentation and additional text files, e.g. [Contributing.md](https://github.com/louvill/AAE535dPCalc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you have problems building.
